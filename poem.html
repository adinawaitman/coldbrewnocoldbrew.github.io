    <b>This Is Just To Say</b><br>
    BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS <br><br>
    I have eaten<br>
    the plums<br>
    that were in<br>
    the icebox<br><br>
    
    and which<br>
    you were probably<br>
    saving<br>
    for breakfast<br><br>
    
    Forgive me<br>
    they were delicious<br>
    so sweet<br>
    and so cold<br>
